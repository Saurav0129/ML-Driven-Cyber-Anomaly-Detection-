# ML-Driven-Cyber-Anomaly-Detection-
This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to detect cyber anomalies using the UGRansom dataset. It demonstrates the implementation and comparison of various classification algorithms for identifying different types of network intrusions and ransomware attacks.

## Key Features:
- Utilizes the UGRansom dataset for analyzing ransomware and zero-day cyberattacks
- Implements and compares multiple ML classifiers:
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Bagging Classifier
- Performs extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Includes data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Provides detailed performance metrics and visualizations

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
